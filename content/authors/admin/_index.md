I have been fortunate to live half of my life in three different countries: Italy, France and USA. This has played a significant role in how I work with diverse teams, as well as my understanding of global cultures and customs.  

Learning is my passion, which is evident from all my years of being in school. In Spring 2020 I have started a MBA (major: Strategic Management & Leadership) and I believe that practical application of this knowledge is key.  

As President and Managing Director of a preclinical CRO, I have frequently flyed over its 2 sites, one in France and one in the US, having the responsibility of the team’s management as well as the company’s financial growth for a total turnover of more than $5M.  

During my years in academic research as well as in the private sector, I had the opportunity to build a strong network, including Veterinary Schools in Italy, France and USA as well as public research institutes (ex. INRAE and INSERM).
