In 2014, my company wanted to develop a new facility in USA. They found a site in Terre Haute, IN, USA and I was given the responsibility to start the activity at this new site.  
As Managing Director, I managed a team of 10-20 persons and developed with them the US operations of AvogadroLS Inc.  
In particular, based on my analysis of the market, I chose to set up a BSL-2 facility and obtained all required registrations and accreditations with the USDA.  
Because animal welfare has always been my top priority, I also designed the operations to obtain the AALAC certification.  
We performed more than 130 preclinical pharmaceutical studies, including studies in BSL-2 environment.
