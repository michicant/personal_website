# Abstract:
abstract: "In cattle, phenobarbital (PB) upregulates target drug-metabolizing enzyme (DME) mRNA levels. However, few data about PB's post-transcriptional effects are actually available. This work provides the first, and an almost complete, characterization of PB-dependent changes in DME catalytic activities in bovine liver using common probe substrates and confirmatory immunoblotting investigations. As expected, PB increased the total cytochrome P450 (CYP) content and the extent of metyrapone binding; moreover, an augmentation of protein amounts and related enzyme activities was observed for known PB targets such as CYP2B, 2C, and 3A, but also CYP2E1. However, contradictory results were obtained for CYP1A, while a decreased catalytic activity was observed for flavin-containing monooxygenases 1 and 3. The barbiturate had no effect on the chosen hydrolytic and conjugative DMEs. For the first time, we also measured the 26S proteasome activity, and the increase observed in PB-treated cattle would suggest this post-translational event might contribute to cattle DME regulation. Overall, this study increased the knowledge of cattle hepatic drug metabolism, and further confirmed the presence of species differences in DME expression and activity between cattle, humans, and rodents. This reinforced the need for an extensive characterization and understanding of comparative molecular mechanisms involved in expression, regulation, and function of DMEs."
