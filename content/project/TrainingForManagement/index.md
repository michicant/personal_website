I have been a manager since 2014 and I learn all the time from my professional experience.  
But, because my first training is in veterinary medicine, science and academia, I also wanted to get a formal training to all the aspects of management and leadership.  
I first followed in 2018-2019 a professional training (equivalent to a Master degree) named ["MÃ©tier Dirigeant"](https://www.tbs-education.fr/formation/metier-dirigeant/) (literally "the job of director") at the [Toulouse Business School](https://www.tbs-education.com/).  
Now, I am diving much deeper into all the aspects of the job since I started in 2020 the [Kelly Direct Online MBA](https://kelley.iu.edu/programs/online/mba/index.html) from the [Kelly Business School](https://kelley.iu.edu/) at [Indiana University](https://www.iu.edu/).  
I will graduate in May 2022 with a major in Strategy and Leadership from this [highly recognized MBA program](https://blog.kelley.iu.edu/2021/03/22/kelley-direct-program-ranked-fifth-worldwide-and-no-2-in-the-u-s-by-the-financial-times/).
