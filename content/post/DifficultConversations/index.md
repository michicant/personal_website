## Overview

  I read the book [Difficult Conversations](https://www.stoneandheen.com/difficult-conversations) during my MBA training and I highly recommend it.  
  We all have at some point to discuss something where emotions, high stakes and precise objectives collide.  
  This books gives practical tools to make a success of these *difficult conversations*.
