The first years of my career were devoted to academic research.  
During my PhD and first post-doc, I studied the impact of illegal treatments that are used in farm animals in the aim of promoting their growth.  
I obtained a position as a lecturer / assistant profesor in pharmacology and toxicology at the University of Torino that I quit in order to settle my family in France.  
In Toulouse, France, I joined the INSERM (institute for medical research) as a postdoctoral fellow and I studied the intestinal absorption of lipids using cell models.  
Following this last experience in academic research I oriented my career toward drug development in the pharmaceutical industry.
